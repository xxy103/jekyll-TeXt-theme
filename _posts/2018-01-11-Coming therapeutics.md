# Coming Therapies

John Carroll at Endpoint recently selected 11 potential companies for near future  ["The Endpoints 11: A group of disruptive upstarts on a do-or-die mission to launch new meds"](https://endpts.com/the-endpoints-11-a-group-of-disruptive-upstarts-on-a-do-or-die-mission-to-launch-new-meds/). Including [Arrakis](https://xxy103.github.io/rna/2017/12/14/The-next-star.html) that I previously mentioned, [Moderna's](https://xxy103.github.io/rna/2017/12/19/mRNA-Therapy.html) potent rival BioNTech, see full list below. 

- [Arrakis Therapeutics](http://arrakistx.com/)
- [Autolus](https://www.autolus.com/)
- [BioNTech](http://biontech.de/)
- [Codiak Biosciences](http://www.codiakbio.com/)
- [Dragonfly Therapeutics](http://dragonflytx.com/)
- [Exonics](http://exonicstx.com/)
- [GammaDelta Therapeutics](https://gammadeltatx.com/)
- [Impact Biosciences](http://impactbiomedicines.com/index.html)
- [Legend Biotech](http://www.legendbiotech.com/)
- [Semma Therapeutics](http://www.semma-tx.com/)
- [Tessa Therapeutics](https://www.tessatherapeutics.com/)


Among those biotechs, gene therapies tools like CAR-T and Cas9 editing are eyecatching in the field. siRNA delivery system hijacking the exosomes from Codiak would also be useful for the RNA therapies, considering the main pipelines mostly used are LNP or GalNAc, this success would in no doubt boost the siRNA delivery or even Cas9 delivery (size limit of the system ??) 

But those companies are also highly risky in the capital field because of the pierce competitions in the capital field and the difficulties in clinical trials.

I am quite exciting to see what the therapeutics would be revolutionized in near future with booming understanding of the life science and much more maturer pipelines like siRNA, CAR-T.
