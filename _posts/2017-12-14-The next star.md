# The next success in RNA-therapeutics?

Yesterday, Arrakis Therapeutics announced exclusive license to RNA-targeted small molecule technology from the University of Pennsylvania.
From [The RNA Drug Hunter](https://cen.acs.org/articles/95/i47/RNA-drug-hunters.html?type=paidArticleContent) article, Arrakis had developed a compound that binds a three-way junction in an undisclosed RNA target. 
See [David M. Chenoweth](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201407061/abstract) paper for more information.

As nucleic acid junctions are ubiquitous in viral genomes and are important structural motifs in riboswitches. Would small molecules gain more focus in near future and become star for developing viral vaccines?
