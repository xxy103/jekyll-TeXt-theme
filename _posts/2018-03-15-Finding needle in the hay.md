# Signal and Noise

When I took the biostatistical course given by Dr. Thomas Love a few
years ago, he recommended us reading a seemingly unrelavent stastical
book " The signal and the noise" by Nate Silver.  The book is great and
uncovers the promises and pitfalls of the big data analysis, one of the
biggest pitfalls is that in most times what we got from the data are
what we would like to hear, and that is deeply rooted in our nature.

Big data is routine is bioscience, and we are generating tons of high
throughput data everyday. The data come in every aspects and
disciplines, from patients clinical electronic records (images), high
throughput drug screening,  proteomics, genomic deep sequencing and
more. But those data are not separated with others, for example, many
different layers of the data for the same target can be integrated into
one database to better understand the mechanisms. Moreover, the
candidate can be further studied in high levels with integrations of
other factors or conditions. Big data are embedded with the clues for
better human health and we need better designs and collaborations to
take advantages of the data. And we also need to be aware of our humanity of believe what we want to
believe.
