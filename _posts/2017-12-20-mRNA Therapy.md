# Witness of a new era

Moderna annouced their pre-clinical data entitled ["Systemic Messenger RNA Therapy as a Treatment for Methylmalonic Acidemia"](http://www.cell.com/cell-reports/abstract/S2211-1247(17)31748-5). They showed positive results for methylmalonic acidemia/aciduria (MMA) murine models by treating with codon-optimized human methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (hMUT) mRNA. This, however is not even counted as their many [clinical trials](https://www.modernatx.com/pipeline/clinical-trials) conducted at Moderna. 

I was following the [two scientists walk into a bar](https://www.gene.com/stories/two-scientists-walk-into-a-bar) from Jane Grogan at Genentech, the title of the podcast was to memorize the wonderful science-business collaborations between Herbert Boyer and Robert A. Swanson, founders of the Genentech. And I've learned a little bit more [history of the company](https://www.amazon.com/Genentech-Beginnings-Sally-Smith-Hughes/dp/022604551X/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1513770718&sr=8-1-spell&keywords=genentch) and its fierce competition in producing the insuline using recombinant DNA technique. The situation of Genentech reminds me of mRNA-based therapy "hidden" biotech Moderna. Moderna was based on a [Derrick J. Rossi' s](https://hsci.harvard.edu/people/derrick-j-rossi-phd) fabulous idea of "transplanting" the modified mRNA into human cells for treatment at 2010; while Genentech was build upon the DNA recombinant technique. So far, I think one of the amazing moment is breakthrough of modified nucleotide patent developed by Katalin Karik√≥ and Drew Weissman at the University of Pennsylvania, Jason Schrum soon found out a variant of pseudouridine called [1-methylpseudouridine](http://www.nature.com/news/business-the-billion-dollar-biotech-1.17674). In the past of synthesizing insuline, Genentech won the war over Walter Gilbert at Harvard University. But what be happen between the mRNA-based therapies competition in the coming future as more companies are developing for RNA therapies, like Ionis, Alnylam, Editas...?
